Dynamical content, on the contrary, will have a slightly increased loading time. When a user hit’s your dynamically generated site, no content will be loaded, to begin with. The first thing that dynamic sites will display is the mere shell of the site - or in other words the basic structure. Next, your websites sends a request to your database where all your content is located, asking for permission to pull out the needed data. Once the request has been approved, the server will load your content from your database and display it on the website. A bad internet connection can have a huge impact on the speed of this process, so this is why statically websites can be favorable for many. That’s not to say that you should choose statically websites over dynamically - it’s just something to be aware of. Pagespeed is of great importance both for your users and the search consoles. Good page speed results can, in other words, mean good SEO."}],"markDefs":[{"_key":"b7227711a20d","_type":"link","href":"https://kodexcph.com/"}],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"15efe570bee9","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"15efe570bee90","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Another benefit to a static website is, that the risk of errors is significantly reduced.

Imagine that you’re running a service like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. These services are highly dependent on updating content. I theory the users are maintaining the content just like a conversion rate optimist would do it in a backend of a website. If Facebook had to be rebuilt every time someone pressed published, I’m sure the servers handling the build process would crash in a glimpse of an eye. In an instance like this, where your content is updated often by the user of your site, it would be a good idea to reach out for technologies like Next.js and Nuxt.js that handles dynamical content very well.
